# FetLife Alleged Abusers Database Engine (FAADE)

The FetLife Alleged Abusers Database Engine, or FAADE, is a tool that alerts you of profiles on [FetLife](https://fetlife.com/) belonging to people who have reportedly violated others' consent, such as through sexual assault or rape. This tool is a response to what is, as of this writing, [one of the most popular suggestions in the FetLife suggestion box](https://fetlife.com/improvements/429):

> Let us name abusers.
>
> Fetlife's Terms of Use include the following prohibitions:
>
> "You agree that, while using BitLove Inc.â€™s Products and Services, you will not:
Personally attack, make fun of, troll, flame, bully, stalk or otherwise harass another member.
Make criminal accusations against another member in a public forum. [...]"
>
> While these conditions may be invoked to stop harassment and to shield Fetlife from liability, they also prevent members of our community from publicly naming and speaking out against abusers, rapists, and other predators. Given Fetlife's prominence and the role it plays in supporting and expanding kink community - particularly its role as a point of entry into the community for young, inexperienced, or otherwise vulnerable people - we feel that Fetlife's current policy is irresponsible and tantamount to enabling abuse. PLEASE CHANGE IT.

FAADE empowers Internet users like you to anonymously report harassment, rape, and other abuses they have experienced at the hands of a person with a FetLife account. Your report is then automatically disemminated to other FAADE users, as well as being published on the open Internet. While browsing FetLife, FAADE will also highlight any user profile you encounter that has allegedly violated another person's consent. Click through to the user's profile for a complete listing of reported consent violations.

### Can I report a consent violation anonymously?

Yes. FAADE will never require the use of your personally identifying information to be reported, nor will it ever collect your personal information. When you file a report of abuse, you are welcome to include as much or as little information about yourself as you feel comfortable doing.

### Can I report a consent violation if I don't have a FetLife account?

Yes. Anyone can file a report, regardles of whether they, themselves, have a FetLife account. However, allegations can only be made *against* users of FetLife.

If you don't have a FetLife account, you can still [access and submit the report form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGNVT1kzSzFnOXhHRjh1RnczZVVmMXc6MQ). However, some fields, such as the person's numeric FetLife user ID and profile name, will not be be automatically filled in. Follow the instructions on the report form to help you complete any fields not already pre-filled.

### Can I remove myself from the database?

No. There will never be an option for removing anyone from the database. And no, I'm not sorry about that.

### What can I do if I've been falsely accused?

You can update your FetLife profile to address the allegation. Be sure to respond to the allegation at the very beginning of your "About me" section so that it is displayed close to the report you believe is false. Each report filed against you is numbered, so if you believe there are multiple false accusations, you can refer to them by number.
